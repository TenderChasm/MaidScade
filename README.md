# MaidScade
The game pet-project in Unity inspired by the “bullethell” genre and “The Binding of Isaac” mechanics (4.5k LOC). The following notable instruments/technologies were applied in the project development: URP/Shader graph with custom post process passes, NavMesh adapted to the 2D environment, Depth-First search for the “Fog of War” system, Animator, the particle system. The majority of game sprites were also created and animated by me.
